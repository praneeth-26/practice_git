How to delete remote branch:

***********************************

git restore - Is a brand new Git command that helps with undoing operations.
For example, "git restore --source HEAD~1 home.html" will restore the contents of home.html to its state from the commit
prior to HEAD. You can also use a particular commit hash as the source.

If you have accidentally added a file to your staging area with git add and you don't wish to include it in the next commit, you can use git restore
to remove it from staging. Use the --staged option like this:
"git restore --staged app.js"
**************************************

git revert is similar to git reset in that they both "undo" changes, but they accomplish it in different ways.
git reset actually moves the branch pointer backwards, eliminating commits.
git revert instead creates a brand new commit which reverses/undos the changes from a commit. Because it results in a new commit,
you will be prompted to enter a commit message.

How to use revert command - "git revert <commit-hash>"
