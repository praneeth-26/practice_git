Today I learned how to:
ensure your local(main) copy is up-to date - "git pull origin main"
create a new copy branch from main - "git branch pdendi_personal"
switch to new branch - "git checkout pdendi_personal" or "git switch pdendi_personal"
commit your changes - "git add *" and "git commit -m "new branch created i.e pdendi_personal""
push the new branch to GitHub - "git push origin pdendi_personal"
--------------------------
7/27/2023
git branch -m feature-branch new-feature-branch - to rename the branch
git push origin -u new-branch-name - to push the new branch name to github.
----------------------------
8/2/2023
if there is an error message like :(
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 4 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

solution: git push origin main
*******
If I am not sure with changes and leads to merge conflict:
If an error occurred while using "git pull"

Steps:
	-> git reset --hard HEAD
	-> git branch -a
    -> git rebase origin/mainline
