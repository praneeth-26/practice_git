Steps to be followed to delete all the local and remote branches except the "main" branch in Git
# Switch to the main branch
git checkout main

# List all local branches except the main branch
git branch | grep -v "main" | xargs git branch -d

# List all remote branches except the main branch
git branch -r | grep -v "origin/main" | sed 's/origin\///' | xargs -I {} git push --delete origin {}
